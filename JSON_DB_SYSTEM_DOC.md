- ‚ú® In-memory storage with sharding
- üîí Password-based authentication
- üîê Optional AES encryption
- ‚è±Ô∏è TTL support for entries
- üîç Pattern matching for key lookups
- üíæ Memory dump/restore functionality
- üö¶ Rate limiting protection

### Client Libraries

- üéØ Laravel/PHP Adaptor
- üü¢ NodeJS Adaptor
- üêò Pure PHP Adaptor
